# Change Control Policy

## Purpose and scope

Establish the Company's 'change control policy' as relates to application development and operations. See [Change Control Standards](../standards/Change%20Control%20Standards.md) for further details.

## Policy



* The Company will implement a Change Control system whereby all applicable changes within the production application environment are documented and approved prior to implementation.
* Any changes to any portion of the production environment are subject to the Change Control Policy. These changes include but are not limited to the following areas: 
   * application code,
   * third party libraries and services,
   * hardware changes (including virtual),
   * system patches and configuration changes, and
   * network changes (including firewall and router).
* Changes to policy, standards, procedures, or guidelines are also subject to Change Control.
* All changes must be reviewed and verified by at least one staff member not involved in implementation of the changes.
* The review will  specifically address regulatory issues and quality standards, each individually reviewed and attested to.
* Environment changes will include post-implementation penetration testing linked the original change request.
* All changes are implemented with a specific rollback plan in place.
